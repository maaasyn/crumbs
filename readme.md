# Crumbs

## Abstract

If you played elden ring, you know how useful/fun the messages left by other players are. This is the same concept but for the web.

The crumbs is a dApp that allows users to create small comments on any website they wish to.
All comments commitment is pernamently stored on chain and can be view by anyone.

## How it works

Each website is represented by a unique hash that is generated by the website's URL.

```sh
cast keccak "https://amazon.com"
# returns 0x8f27e3e37487112bee4cf14def31d887af3a99e26bf5ec708e3e14860b4a8546
```

The user can then create a comment on the website by signing the hash of the website and the comment itself.

```sh
cast keccak "as a society we outgrew the usefulness of capitalism"

# returns 0xf959ee04dfdb523c2cb144deb673a6d8a755b0a3a26f39eb1be1a13d9c9bc51a
```

The user can then submit the comment to the contract by calling the `storeComment(bytes32 _url, bytes32 _commentHash)` function with the hash of the website and the comment.

The comment is then stored on chain and can be viewed by anyone.

Technically, there is no reason why you shouldn't be able to send the commitment of entire Kalevala to the chain, but as of now, I won't be indexing offchain any comment that is larger than ~280 characters.

To view the comment content, we need a hash to value dictionary, which is stored offchain.
